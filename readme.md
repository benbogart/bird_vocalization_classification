## Problem Description

Bird migration patterns are changing, and little is know and nighttime bird migration because the communities that generally track birds by sight do so during daylight hours.

Wildlife sounds offer a powerful way to identify species that has some advantages over photographic methods.  For example, bird sounds can be recorded just as easily at night as during the day, and the recording device does not need to be aimed in the direction of the sound to pick it up.

This project aims to build a bird species classifier that uses audio recordings of bird sounds (calls and songs) as its source material.

## The Data

The initial dataset came from the Kaggle competition ["Cornell Birdcall Identification"](https://www.kaggle.com/c/birdsong-recognition) which contains 19,949 mp3 recordings.

The recordings are of 264 species recorded at locations around the world illustrated below.

![Recording locations](images/recording-locations.png)

The vast majority of the recordings were only several seconds long.  The shortest recording was less than half a second while the longest was approximately 38 minutes long.

Furthermore, the sampling rate varied between the recordings.  Although the vast majority of recordings had a sample rate of 44.1khz, several other sample rates were represented in the dataset

![Sample Rate Distribution](images/sampe-rate-distribution.png)

### Additional Data

I augmented that dataset by using the [xeno-canto.org](http://xeno-canto.org) api to download another 41,335 recordings of the same species.

### Preprocessing

The data was first resampled to 22050hz.  From there two separate training sets were created.

1. In the first set the mp3 files were cropped to the first 10 seconds and converted to wav files.  In cases where the files were shorter than 10 seconds in length, the files were padded with silence to extend them to 10 seconds.
2. The second set included converting the full audio files to numpy arrays saved as npy files.  This allowed for faster access with the data augmentation strategies described below.

### Data Augmentation

I developed a custom DataGenerator ([AugDataGenerator](training_scripts/remote/DataGenerator.py)) which performed the following data augmentations for evaluation of their effectiveness.

- Extraction of a random 10 second sample from the recordings
- Pitch Shift
- Time Stretch

As expected, the extraction of random 10 second samples from the data did improve the model effectiveness significantly.  Pitch and Time Stretch however slightly diminished the model's predictive power and so they were not used in the best model.

## Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python

All of the training compute for this project was done on the Azure Machine Learning cloud by way of the AML SDK for Python. This allowed for faster training and more iterations than I could have accomplished on my own computer.  All of the files used for accessing, creating, and running azure assets is located in the `training_scripts` directory.

Some of the models were trained with on compute instance with multiple GPUs.  The number of GPUs used for each model training is recorded in the `training_scripts/runids.csv` and also in the arguments.

`training_scripts/runs.sh` contains all commands run at the command line.  You can run any of the commands there by uncommenting them and running the `./training_scripts/runs.sh` at the command line.

In order to track model training in realtime I wrote a [custom Keras callback](training_scripts/remote/LogToAzure.py) which records metrics after each training Epoch and at the end of the training.

## Modeling

Modeling was done with tensorflow and Keras.  In order to test the effect of the Mel Specrogram hyper parameters I used the kapre library [[1]](#1) to add eras layers to which dynamically generate the Mel Spectrograms during training.  The Mel Spectrogram is a matrix representation of frequency magnitude that bins frequencies on a log scale similar to how humans hear and measures magnitude in decibels.  The Mel Spectrogram can be visualized as heat map.  In doing so we can clearly "see" the bird vocalization represented as an image.

![Mel Spectrogram](images/mel-spectrogram.png)

Once the sound has an image representation we can use a traditional Convolutional Neural Network to extract features and make predictions.  I tested 30 different models in this project and the test accuracy for each is charted below.

### Model Summary

The best performing model:

- Name: `milsed_7block_dense`
- Data: kaggle_full_length_npy_aug

#### Model: `milsed_7block_dense`

`milsed_7block_dense` uses layers from kapre to generate the mel spectrogram from the audio source.  The resulting mel spectrogram was then passed through 7 convolution blocks, each with two conv2d layers  inspired by the convolution layers used in "Adaptive Pooling Operators for Weakly Labeled Sound Event Detection" [[2]](#2).  Each block contains a conv2d layer with a (3, 3) kernel and relu activation, batch_normalization, another conv2d (3,3) with relu layer, followed by a Max Pooling layer with a kernel size of (3,3).  The rest of the model consists of Global Max Pooling to flatten the output, two Dense layers and a final Dense layer with 246 nodes and a softmax activation function for the final prediction.

#### Data: `kaggle_full_length_npy_aug`

The dataset `kaggle_full_length_npy_aug` used full length audio files with 10 second data extraction for augmentation as described above.

## Performance

### Train/Validation Accuracy

I tracked 3 accuracy metrics during training: accuracy, top 3 accuracy, and top 5 accuracy.

![Accuracy Plots](images/accuracy.png)

### Test Accuracy

![Test Accuracy best model](images/best-test-accuracy.png)

There is some overfitting, however the test accuracy is almost identical to the validation accuracy which indicates that the overfitting does not negatively affect model performance.

### Confusion Matrix

Although there are too many classes to fit comfortably in the confusion matrix, the matrix is still informative.  It shows a strong tendency toward correct classification and no obvious recurring mis-classifications.

![Confusion Matrix](images/confusion-matrix.png)

### Classification Report

The classification report exposes some interesting (and expected) details.  Some birds with a small number of samples are not ever predicted (i.e. Bufflehead).  All in all the model is fairly balanced with

## Training Efficiency

Unfortunately the custom data generator resulted in inefficient use of resources as seen in the plot below.  I did not record file load times, but the los cpu utilization between GPU spikes seems to indicate that the loading of the audio files themselves was constraining the system.  The files were processed in parallel on all CPUs available but still the CPU only reached 60%.

For larger training sets this would need to be addressed.

# Dashboard

To upload your own recordings for prediction or to dig deeper into the metrics for the other models I have deployed a dashboard on Heroku.  The dashboard uses a Docker Container to install ffmpeg for mp3 processing to facilitate the upload and prediction.  It is build using Plotly's [Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/).  To see more on how the dashboard works visit the [dashboard repository](https://github.com/benbogart/birdsong_detection_dashboard_docker) on GitHub.

# Future Work

1. Further improvements might be possible by **testing other model architectures** like LSTM or attention based networks.
2. Create a Sound Event Detection model leveraging the AutoPooling layer from âAdaptive Pooling Operators for Weakly Labeled Sound Event Detection.â  This could have the added benefit of detecting multiple species in a recording.
3. Develop an open source mobile app so the community can improve the modeling and the benefits of the model can be leveraged by hobbyists and researchers alike.
4. Improve training efficiency by using a different data loading methodology.

# Conclusion

Its clear form this work that bird vocalization classification is a viable way to classify bird species.  Pitch shift and time stretching the audio data had a nominally negative effect on the model performance, and are computationally expensive, therefor use of those augmentation strategies is not recommended.  Data augmentation by selecting random samples and downloading more samples does significantly improve the training.
